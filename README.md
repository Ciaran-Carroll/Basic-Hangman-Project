# Basic Hangman Project

A basic Hangman Project with Python that uses a file <i>'words.txt'</i> in the same directory as the Python script to generate test words for the Hangman Game. It is intended to be a simple-to-use program for beginner Python developers while demonstrating key principles of the language such as conditional statements.

The program chooses a random word from the <i>'words.txt'</i> file for the user to guess.

The score in the game is calculated by counting the number of guessed letters by the user, not just the guesses that the user guessed correctly which is more in tune with how the game is played in practice.
